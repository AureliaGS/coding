jgame.js is a revised port of JGame, a multiplatform Java engine for 2D
games (http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/).

jgame.js consists of the following components:

gl.js - basic WebGL functions
gldraw.js - draw functions (note: shader code is found in index.html)
jgengine.js - screen, input events, game states
jgobject.js - game object handling
jgtiles.js - tile handling
jgaudio.js - audio handling
jgmenu.js - menu system

The current implementation is a fairly complete rendition of the JGame API,
but still has a number of issues. Such as:

- some hard-coded references to globals
- no nice directory structure

This version is packaged with a full example game, Tsunami Cruiser.
